# Leveraging AI for Small Business Success: A Practical Guide

## Introduction
This guide will help you use AI tools effectively to grow your business, improve operations, and increase revenue. While there are many AI tools available, we'll focus on practical prompting techniques that work across most AI platforms.

## Part 1: Basic Principles for Effective AI Prompting

### Be Specific and Detailed
❌ Weak: "Help me with marketing."
✅ Strong: "Create a 3-month social media marketing plan for my local coffee shop targeting young professionals, age 25-35."

### Provide Context
❌ Weak: "Write an email to customers."
✅ Strong: "Write an email announcing our new Saturday business hours to our retail customers. We're a family-owned hardware store that's been in business for 15 years."

### Break Down Complex Requests
Instead of asking for everything at once, break your request into steps:
1. "First, analyze my target market..."
2. "Based on that analysis, suggest marketing channels..."
3. "Now, create specific content for each channel..."
